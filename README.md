# AutoEis.py
------------
AutoEis is a Python package to automatically propose statistical plausible equivalent circuit models (ECMs) for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. The package is designed for researchers and practitioners in the fields of electrochemical analysis, including but not limited to explorations of electrocatalysis, battery design, and investigations of material degradations.

AutoEis contains the following steps.

Please be aware that the current version is only the beta test and has not been formally realized. If you find any bug and any suggestions, please [file an issue](https://github.com/AUTODIAL/Auto_Eis/issues) or directly [pull requests](https://github.com/AUTODIAL/Auto_Eis/pulls). We would really appreciate any contributions from our commmunity.
