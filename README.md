# AutoEIS
## What is AutoEIS?
AutoEIS is a Python package that automatically proposes statistically plausible equivalent circuit models (ECMs) for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. The package is designed for researchers and practitioners in the fields of electrochemical analysis, including but not limited to explorations of electrocatalysis, battery design, and investigations of material degradation.

Please be aware that the current version is still under development and has not been formally released. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please file an [issue](https://github.com/AUTODIAL/AutoEIS/issues) or directly submit a [pull request](https://github.com/AUTODIAL/AutoEIS/pulls). We would greatly appreciate any contributions from the community.

## Installation
Follow the instructions below to install AutoEIS and its dependencies:

### Install Julia
The official way to install Julia is via [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). [Juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) provides a command line interface to automatically install Julia (optionally multiple versions side by side). Working with [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) is straightforward; Please follow the instructions on its GitHub [page](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup).

<details>
  <summary>Julia manual setup (not recommended)</summary>
  
  **We strongly recommend that you install Julia using juliaup (see [Install Julia](#install-julia)). If you've already done so, skip this step and go the [next](#install-autoeis-using-pip)**. However, if for any reason, you insist on using your own Julia installation, you need to ensure that `julia` command can be found in your `PATH` environment variable. You can test this by running the command `julia` in a terminal (or command prompt on Windows). If an error message appears stating `julia is not recognized as an internal or external command`, you need to add the path to the Julia executable to your `PATH` environment variable. You can find instructions on how to do this [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#windows).

</details>

### Install AutoEIS using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/autoeis)
Open a terminal (or command prompt on Windows) and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -U autoeis
```

<details>
  <summary>Install JAX (skip now, come back only if you encounter errors on Windows)</summary>
  
  If you're on Windows, you **might** need to manually install `jaxlib` (We recommend that you skip this step for now, and come back only if you encounter any errors while using AutoEIS). For CPU version, run the following command in a command prompt:
  
  ```shell
  pip install "jax[cpu]===0.4.11" -f https://whls.blob.core.windows.net/unstable/index.html --use-deprecated legacy-resolver
  ```
  
  For GPU support, use the following command instead:
  
  ```shell
  pip install jax[cuda111] -f https://whls.blob.core.windows.net/unstable/index.html --use-deprecated legacy-resolver
  ```
  
  If you encounter any problem running above commands, visit [jax-windows-builder](https://github.com/cloudhan/jax-windows-builder) repository to find and install a compatible version. You can find more detailed instructions there.

</details>

### Install Julia dependencies
The circuit generation is done using the Julia package [EquivalentCircuits.jl](https://github.com/MaximeVH/EquivalentCircuits.jl). AutoEIS provides a helper function to automatically install the required Julia dependencies. Open a terminal (or command prompt on Windows) and run the following command:

```shell
python -m autoeis install
```

**Note:** AutoEIS doesn't pollute your global Julia environment. Instead, it creates a new shared environment called `autoeis-VERSION_NUMBER` (`VERSION_NUMBER` is the AutoEIS version) and installs the required packages there. This way, you can safely use AutoEIS without worrying about breaking your existing Julia environment. Shared environments are stored in the `~/.julia/environments` directory on Unix-based systems and `%USERPROFILE%\.julia\environments` on Windows.

### Verify the installation
If all steps were completed successfully, you should now be able to use AutoEIS. To confirm that AutoEIS is installed correctly, running the following command in a terminal (or command prompt on Windows) should print the version number:

```shell
python -c "import autoeis; print(autoeis.__version__)"
```

## Workflow
The schematic workflow of AutoEIS is shown below:

![AutoEIS workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AUTODIAL/AutoEIS/develop/assets/workflow.png)

It includes: data pre-processing, ECM generation, circuit post-filtering, Bayesian inference, and the model evaluation process. Through this workflow, AutoEis can prioritize the statistically optimal ECM and also retain suboptimal models with lower priority for subsequent expert inspection. A detailed workflow can be found in the [paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1945-7111/aceab2/meta).

## Usage
To use AutoEIS, you can either perform the circuit generation and Bayesian inference step by step or use the `perform_full_analysis` function to perform the whole process automatically. The following is an example of how to use the `perform_full_analysis` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import autoeis as ae

# Load test dataset shipped with AutoEIS
Z, freq = ae.io.load_test_dataset()

# Perform automated EIS analysis
circuits = ae.perform_full_analysis(Z, freq, iters=100, parallel=True)
print(circuits)
```

- `Z`: Electrochemical impedance measurements (complex array)
- `freq`: Frequencies corresponding to the impedance measurements
- `iters`: Numbers of equivalent circuit generation to be performed
- `parallel`: Whether to use parallel processing to speed up the analysis
  
An example notebook that demonstrates how to use AutoEIS can be found [here](https://github.com/AUTODIAL/AutoEIS/blob/develop/examples/autoeis_demo.ipynb).

# Work in progress/known issues
- [x] Refactor the code as it is still in the developmental stage and not yet production-ready.
- [x] Speed up the code; Currently, it takes ~ 4 hours to generate 100 equivalent circuits (your mileage may vary).
- [x] Add proper unit/integration tests.
- [x] Add proper documentation (API, more examples, etc.).
- [ ] Add a graphical user interface for a more user-friendly interaction.
