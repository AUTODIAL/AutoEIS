> _Want to get notified about major announcements/new features?_ Please click on "Watch" -> "Custom" -> Check "Releases". Starring the repository alone won't notify you when we make a new release. This is particularly useful since we're actively working on adding new features/improvements to AutoEIS. Currently, we might issue a new release every month, so rest assured that you won't be spammed.

# AutoEIS

## What is AutoEIS?

AutoEIS (Auto ee-eye-ess) is a Python package that automatically proposes statistically plausible equivalent circuit models (ECMs) for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. The package is designed for researchers and practitioners in the fields of electrochemical analysis, including but not limited to explorations of electrocatalysis, battery design, and investigations of material degradation.

AutoEIS is still under development and the API might change. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please file an [issue](https://github.com/AUTODIAL/AutoEIS/issues) or directly submit a [pull request](https://github.com/AUTODIAL/AutoEIS/pulls). We would greatly appreciate any contributions from the community.

## Installation

### Pip

Open a terminal (or command prompt on Windows) and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -U autoeis
```

Julia dependencies will be automatically installed at first import. It's recommended that you have your own Julia installation, but if you don't, Julia itself will also be installed automatically.

> **How to install Julia?** If you decided to have your own Julia installation (recommended), the official way to install Julia is via [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). [Juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) provides a command line interface to automatically install Julia (optionally multiple versions side by side). Working with [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) is straightforward; Please follow the instructions on its GitHub [page](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup).

## Usage

Visit our [example notebooks](https://autodial.github.io/AutoEIS/examples.html) page to learn how to use AutoEIS.

## Workflow

The schematic workflow of AutoEIS is shown below:

![AutoEIS workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AUTODIAL/AutoEIS/develop/assets/workflow.png)

It includes: data pre-processing, ECM generation, circuit post-filtering, Bayesian inference, and the model evaluation process. Through this workflow, AutoEis can prioritize the statistically optimal ECM and also retain suboptimal models with lower priority for subsequent expert inspection. A detailed workflow can be found in the [paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1945-7111/aceab2/meta).
