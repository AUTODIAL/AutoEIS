# AutoEIS
## What is AutoEIS?
AutoEIS is a Python package that automatically proposes statistically plausible equivalent circuit models (ECMs) for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. The package is designed for researchers and practitioners in the fields of electrochemical analysis, including but not limited to explorations of electrocatalysis, battery design, and investigations of material degradation.

AutoEIS is still under development and the API is not stable. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please file an [issue](https://github.com/AUTODIAL/AutoEIS/issues) or directly submit a [pull request](https://github.com/AUTODIAL/AutoEIS/pulls). We would greatly appreciate any contributions from the community.

## Installation

### Pip

Open a terminal (or command prompt on Windows) and run the following command:

```bash
pip install -U autoeis
```

Julia dependencies will be automatically installed at first import. It's recommended that you have your own Julia installation, but if you don't, Julia itself will also be installed automatically.

> **How to install Julia?** If you decided to have your own Julia installation (recommended), the official way to install Julia is via [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup). [Juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) provides a command line interface to automatically install Julia (optionally multiple versions side by side). Working with [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) is straightforward; Please follow the instructions on its GitHub [page](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup).

## Workflow
The schematic workflow of AutoEIS is shown below:

![AutoEIS workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AUTODIAL/AutoEIS/develop/assets/workflow.png)

It includes: data pre-processing, ECM generation, circuit post-filtering, Bayesian inference, and the model evaluation process. Through this workflow, AutoEis can prioritize the statistically optimal ECM and also retain suboptimal models with lower priority for subsequent expert inspection. A detailed workflow can be found in the [paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/1945-7111/aceab2/meta).

## Usage
To use AutoEIS, you can either perform the circuit generation and Bayesian inference step by step or use the `perform_full_analysis` function to perform the whole process automatically. The following is an example of how to use the `perform_full_analysis` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import autoeis as ae

# Load test dataset shipped with AutoEIS
Z, freq = ae.io.load_test_dataset()

# Perform automated EIS analysis
circuits = ae.perform_full_analysis(freq, Z, iters=100, parallel=True)
print(circuits)

# Print summary of the results
mcmcs, status = circuits["MCMC (chain)"], circuits["MCMC (status)"]
for mcmc, stat, circuit in zip(mcmcs, status, circuits.circuitstring):
    if stat == 0:
        ae.visualization.print_summary_statistics(mcmc, circuit)
```

- `Z`: Electrochemical impedance measurements (complex array)
- `freq`: Frequencies corresponding to the impedance measurements
- `iters`: Numbers of equivalent circuit generation to be performed
- `tol`: Tolerance for the evolutionary algorithm for generating equivalent circuits
- `parallel`: Whether to use parallel processing to speed up the analysis
