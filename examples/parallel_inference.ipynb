    "In this notebook, we'll learn how to analyze EIS data in batch mode. Normally, you have a single set of EIS data, i.e., set of impedance measurements at various frequencies, plus a common circuit model that you want to fit to the data. This is what we call single circuit, single dataset or SCSD in short. However, there are two other modes of analysis that you might encounter in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single circuit, multiple datasets (SCMD): You have multiple datasets, each with its own impedance measurements, but you want to fit the same circuit model to all of them. A good example of this is when you have EIS data for multiple samples which you want to compare, or a single sample under different conditions, e.g., EIS data at different cycles during battery cycling.\n",
