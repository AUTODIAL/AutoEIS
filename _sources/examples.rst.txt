Examples
========

The following examples demonstrate how to use AutoEIS to perform EIS analysis. You can download the examples from the main `AutoEIS repository <https://github.com/AUTODIAL/AutoEIS>`__. To run the examples, you need to install `jupyter notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`__. If you have any questions or issues running the examples, please open an `issue <https://github.com/AUTODIAL/AutoEIS/issues>`__ or directly submit a `pull request <https://github.com/AUTODIAL/AutoEIS/pulls>`__. We would greatly appreciate any contributions from the community.

AutoEIS is still under development, and we will add more examples as we make progress. In the meantime, feel free to explore the functionalities via the `API reference <modules>`__. If you have any suggestions for new examples, please open an `issue <https://github.com/AUTODIAL/AutoEIS/issues>`__ or directly submit a `pull request <https://github.com/AUTODIAL/AutoEIS/pulls>`__.
